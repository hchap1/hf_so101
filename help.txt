SYSTEM OVERVIEW
---------------
This program exposes a simple comma-separated command-line interface to control a 6-DOF robotic arm.
Commands are executed strictly in order. There is no concurrency, interpolation, or safety checking.
The agent is fully responsible for issuing physically valid commands.

Each command is a single instruction.
Multiple commands are separated by ", " (comma + space).
All numeric values are REQUIRED and positional.

Example invocation:
python3 my_app.py set 8 -2 17 -80 0.5 0.8, sleep 1.0, get


AVAILABLE COMMANDS
------------------

1) set X Y Z WRIST_PITCH ROLL CLAW

Moves the arm to a Cartesian target, solving inverse kinematics to place the *claw tip*.

Parameters:
- X (cm): horizontal position
  + right, - left

- Y (cm): vertical position
  + up, - down
  ground level ≈ 0

- Z (cm): forward position
  + forward, - backward

- WRIST_PITCH (degrees):
  Orientation of the claw relative to the world
  0   = horizontal
  -120 = straight down

- ROLL (0.0–1.0):
  Axial rotation of the claw
  0.5 ≈ neutral

- CLAW (0.0–1.0):
  Gripper position
  0.0 = fully closed
  0.7 = fully open

Behavior:
- Uses full 3D inverse kinematics
- Automatically computes yaw, shoulder, elbow, and wrist
- If the target is unreachable, it will clamp to the nearest reachable pose
- No collision checking is performed


2) get

Reads the current arm state using forward kinematics and prints it.

Output meaning:
- X: horizontal claw-tip position (cm), +right
- Y: vertical claw-tip position (cm), +up
- Z: forward claw-tip position (cm), +forward
- WristPitch: claw orientation in degrees
- Roll: claw axial rotation (normalized)
- Claw: gripper openness (normalized)

This represents the *actual* inferred pose, not the last commanded pose.


3) sleep SECONDS

Pauses execution for the given duration.

Parameters:
- SECONDS (float): time to wait

Behavior:
- Blocking delay
- Used to allow the arm time to physically move before issuing the next command


COMMAND EXECUTION RULES
-----------------------
- Commands execute sequentially, in order
- All parameters must be provided
- No named arguments
- No units conversion inside commands (always cm and degrees)
- Errors will raise exceptions and stop execution
- The arm is assumed to start wherever it physically is


IMPORTANT NOTES FOR AGENTS
--------------------------
- Always use sleep between large movements
- Avoid sudden large Z decreases near the ground
- Wrist pitch does NOT change position; do not compensate for it manually
- The system does not enforce joint limits beyond basic reachability
- Assume gravity, inertia, and real-world delays exist
- When attempting to grab an object, ALWAYS stop above it, with the claw open, and wait for at least a second before then dipping down and closing the claw.

SUMMARY
-------
You control the arm by issuing:
- set  -> move the claw tip
- get  -> read current claw state
- sleep -> wait

Everything else is your responsibility.
