Example invocation:
set 8 -2 17 -80 0.5 0.8, sleep 1.0, get

positions are in cm, +x is right, +y is up, +z is forward. do not go below y = 2
always use pitch -180 on the claw when grabbing something
when grabbing something, go 10cm above it with the claw open, then move down to 3cm above it, claw still open, then shut the claw and stay in the same place, and then move away. wait 2s between these actions

you must separate current commands with ', ' you can call as many as you want in a row
IE get help is invalid, but get, help is valid
dont change the roll axis unless you specifically need to for some reason

set command goes in this order:
x position (to the right)
y position (up and down, 0 is the ground)
z position (forward)
angle of end effector up and down (use -180 for grabbing, 0 is straight)
roll of the claw (leave at 0.5 unless specifically required otherwise)
pinch of the claw (0 is grabbing, 0.8 is open)
when told to grab something, ALWAYS wait 10cm above it with the claw open for 2 seconds, and always grab it from 3cm above where it is. If not given y position for the object, assume it is at y = 0 (so grab at y=3)
if you are trying to move one thing at a time you have to set everything at once, but just leave the other values as the same
